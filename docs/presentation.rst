Porting the Mini-Kanren logic system to Scala
=============================================

Abstract
--------

Mini-Kanren is a simplified implementation of Kanren, a declarative
logic system, embedded in a pure functional subset of Scheme.

It is used at Indiana University in both undergraduate and graduate
programming language courses, with graduate students being required to
reimplement MK in a (non-Lisp) programming language of their choice.
